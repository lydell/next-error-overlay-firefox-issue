# Next.js error overlay Firefox issue

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm start`
3. Go to <http://localhost:3000> in Firefox. That page contains an error. The
   error overlay is not shown (but is shown in Chrome).
4. Go to <http://localhost:3000/link> in Firefox and click the link to the
   start page there. Now the error overlay _is_ shown.
